  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>For the final project, I want to create a website that can create pixel art for designers, even for non designers who are interested in creating pixel arts. Also, I hope it could show some of the artwork that other people made. The reason that I want to choose pixel art is that it is widely used in all art related industry and it is easy for people who do not have a rich art background to get started in art. I first had this idea when my friend, a game design major student, told me that she had difficulty creating artwork for her game since she does not have any artists in her group. And she told me that she can create some simple artwork by herself, and pixel art can be a great option.</p>
  <p>I first looked at the history of pixel art by reading "Graphic Design: A New History". It originates back to the graphic art of Atari video games before smoothing software evolved. This helped me understand its origin and how it is used in the first place. As it mentioned, it was first used in video games, which is also how I want my website to be used -- for creating artworks for games and other design related fields. I believe that it would be super convenient to have a pixel art website, making pixel art and sharing artworks.</p>
  <p>Then I looked at some examples of pixel art by looking at "Pixel art: great examples". This page showed many great pixel artworks by other people. They also included different types of pixel art, including 3D pixel art, pixel art on furniture, pixel art in video games, etc. This helped me understand that how pixel art can be applied to different fields, ranging from fashion design to game design.</p>
  <p>I also looked at the website about "The Best Online Art Communities for Artists", which shares some really good art communities. By studying their UI/UX design, I have a better understanding about how I should build this project. I believe that the ability to share our ideas with other people is really important. It can be beneficial to the people who share their ideas, and can be beneficial to those who listen to others' ideas.</p>
